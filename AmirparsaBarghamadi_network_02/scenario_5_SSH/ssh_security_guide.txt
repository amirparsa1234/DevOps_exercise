SSH security

What to change:
- Change port (example 2222)
- Disable root login
- Disable password login (use keys)
- Limit auth tries

Why disable PasswordAuthentication:
- Password can be guessed/brute-forced.
- Keys are safer when protected.

Why disable root login:
- Attackers always try "root".
- Use a normal user + sudo.

How to monitor failed logins:
  grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 20

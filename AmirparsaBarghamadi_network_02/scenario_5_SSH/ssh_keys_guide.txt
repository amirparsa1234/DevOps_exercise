SSH keys

Make RSA 2048 key:
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/mykey -N ""

Public key file:
  ~/.ssh/mykey.pub

Copy public key to server:
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub user@server

Passwordless login idea:
- server keeps your public key in: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- you prove you own the private key when you connect
